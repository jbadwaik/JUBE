# Prerequisites

JUBE version 2 is written in the Python programming language.

You need Python 3.2 (or a higher version) to run the program.

JUBE is not compatible to Python2.x any longer.

# Installation

After download, unpack the distribution file `JUBE-<version>.tar.gz` with:

```bash
tar -xf JUBE-<version>.tar.gz
```

You can install the files to your `$HOME/.local` directory by using:

```bash
cd JUBE-<version>
python setup.py install --user
```

`$HOME/.local/bin` must be inside your `$PATH` environment variable to use JUBE in an easy way.

Instead you can also specify a self defined path prefix:

```bash
python setup.py install --prefix=<some_path>
```

You might be asked during the installation to add your path (and some subfolders) to the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable (this should be stored in your profile settings):

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=<needed_path>:$PYTHONPATH
```

Another option is to use `pip[3]` for installation (including download):

```bash
pip3 install http://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/jube/jube2/download.php?version=latest --user
# or
pip3 install http://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/jube/jube2/download.php?version=latest --prefix=<some_path>
```

In addition it is useful to also set the `$PATH` variable again.

To check the installation you can run:


```
jube --version
```

Without the `--user` or `--prefix` argument, JUBE will be installed in the standard system path for Python packages.
